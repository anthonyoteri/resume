Are you searching for a software engineer with a proven track record for developing enterprise-quality applications using current technologies and software development methodologys? If so, please consider my enclosed resume.

Since 2013 I have been a critical player in the R\&D team at Edgeware, where my contributions have helped the company become a market leader in our segment.  At Edgeware, we build hardware and software systems that deliver TV content over IP networks, providing operators the ability to deliver an outstanding viewing experience to their customers at massive scales.  The Edgeware TV servers automatically cache popular TV shows close to the viewer, insert personalized ads, pause live TV, and perform on-the-fly transcoding of media formats, as well as the TV Analyics which provides operators unique insights into viewer behavior.  

With over 15 years of professional experience, I have extensively participated in all aspects of the software development lifecycle, from communicating with customers to determine feature requirements, producing detailed specifications, to overseeing the complete software development process.  I pride myself in keeping current with modern technologies, languages, and methodologies, and with producing well-written, quality software and documentation.

My extensive software development experience and ability to learn and adapt quickly will enable me to step into a role as a lead software engineer or engineering manager and hit the ground running.  I will follow up with you in the next few days, and I may be reached at (774)285-4003.  I look forward to speaking with you soon.
